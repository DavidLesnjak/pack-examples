# STMicroelectronics NUCLEO-U031R8

## Overview

The STM32 Nucleo-64 board provides an affordable and flexible way for users to try out new concepts and build prototypes by choosing from the various combinations of performance and power consumption features provided by the STM32 microcontroller. For the compatible boards, the internal or external SMPS significantly reduces power consumption in Run mode. The ARDUINOÂ® Uno V3 connectivity support and the ST morpho headers allow the easy expansion of the functionality of the STM32 Nucleo open development platform with a wide choice of specialized shields.

## CMSIS-Drivers

This board support pack contains a CMSIS-Driver for the [VIO](https://arm-software.github.io/CMSIS_6/latest/Driver/group__vio__interface__gr.html) interface. This is a virtual I/O abstraction for peripherals that are typically used in example projects. The **Blinky** example uses this interface to create a blinking light with the USER LED mounted on the board that can be controlled by the **Button USER**.
