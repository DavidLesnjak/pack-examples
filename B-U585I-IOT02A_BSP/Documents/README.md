# Overview

The B-U585I-IOT02A Discovery kit provides a complete demonstration and development platform for the STM32U585AI
microcontroller, featuring an Arm Cortex-M33 core, 2 Mbytes of Flash memory and 786 Kbytes of SRAM, as well as smart
peripheral resources. This Discovery kit enables a wide diversity of applications by exploiting low-power communication,
multi way sensing, and direct connection to cloud servers.

It includes Wi-Fi® and Bluetooth® modules, as well as microphones, temperature and humidity, magnetometer, accelerometer and
gyroscope, pressure, time-of-flight, and gesture-detection sensors.

The support for ARDUINO® Uno V3, STMod+, and Pmod™ connectivity provides unlimited expansion capabilities with a large
choice of specialized add-on boards. The on-board STLINK-V3E debugger provides out-of-the-box debugging capabilities, as
well as a USB Virtual COM port bridge.
